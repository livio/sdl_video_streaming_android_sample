# sdl_video_streaming_android_sample
## Getting Started
Download and install the latest release on an Android device. If you plug the device into a module running core with USB/AOA support, the app should begin streaming a video to the screen.

## Directions for Building
Clone and run the project on your Android device. You can try replacing the video we use `sdl.mp4` in the `res/raw` directory with a video of your own with the same name.

## Notes
- This app is for testing purposes only. 
- Touch events are not used in this app.
- The video stream used is not of the app itself, but a stored, local video file.
